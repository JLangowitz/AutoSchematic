    of frizing parts, which contain 3 views, breadboard, schematic, and pcb.
    The instances also have an attribute called moduleIdRef, which is 'WireModuleID'
    for wires, which are what we care about. Within the breadboard view,
    each wire has a 'geometry' child, with attributes 'x2' and 'y2' which contain the
    x and y dimensions of a wire. Each wire also has a 'wireExtras' child, which has an
    attribute called 'color', which gives us the color. These are the only things we need,
